This is the python library for the [Samurai API](http://feefighters.com/samurai) from [Fee Fighters](http://feefighters.com). It allows you easily store customer payment information, and create transactions, without having to ever worry about having their credit card number cross your server.

(README in progress)

# Overview

## Payment Method

This a set of credentials for making a credit card payment. It includes:

* __less sensitive data__ that you will have access to (name, address, credit card expiration date, etc)
* __more sensitive data__ that you won't have access to (credit card number and cvv)
* __the state of the payment method__ (is data valid, is payment method redacted, etc)

Each Payment Method is identified by a `payment_method_token`.

## Transaction

This is an action taken based on a payment method, and/or a previous transaction. There are a 5 different types of transactions.

* __purchase__ - a complete payment
* __authorize__ - the first part of a two-step payment
* __capture__ - the second part of a two-step payment
* __void__ - the cancelation of any previous payment
* __credit__ - a partial or complete refund on an existing completed payment

Each Transaction is identified by a `reference_id`, and each set of transactions that relate to each other (the capture for an earlier authorize, the void of an earlier purchase, etc) is identified by a `transaction_token`.

# Installation

This library currently isn't a proper Python package, so you will have to get the source. The main directory serves as a module, though you should rename it to something like `samurai_client_python`, since dashes aren't valid for module names. The directory also works as a Django application, if you would like to use it for that.

# Core 

The module `samurai_client_python.core` and the file _transparent_redirect.html.example_ contain everything necessary to use the Samurai API. You will be in charge of saving references to Payment Methods and Transactions [Read More](/FeeFighters/samurai-client-python/blob/master/docs/core.md)

# Django

The modules `samurai_client_python.models`, `samurai_client_python.urls`, `samurai_client_python.views` make up a Django app which call on `samurai_client_python.core`. [Read More](/FeeFighters/samurai-client-python/blob/master/docs/django.md) (Though read first about Core, above)

# Testing

This is if you want to run samurai_client_python test suite. It's good to test the code, and also to test if anything is wrong or just changed with the samurai API. If you suddenly start having unexplainable problems, this might be a good place to start.

## Credentials

If you want any of the tests to pass, you will need to create a file called test_credentials.py. Look at test_credentials.py.example for what to put in. __Do not__ put credentials from real merchants or processors into this file. You should get test credentials from FeeFighters.

## Django

If you don't have this properly configured as part of Django, the Django tests will not pass.

## Running

Testing only core.py:

    python test.py

This will run every test, and fail the Django ones:

Testing everything:

    ./manage.py test samurai_client_python

This requires that you have samurai_client_python in your INSTALLED_APPS.
