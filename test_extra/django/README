This is included in case you don't have a Django environment set up, and you want to set one up real quick to run all the tests successfully.

Install Django, 1.2 or later.

Copy settings.py and manage.py to your main samurai directory.

Assuming samurai is in a directory called "samurai_client_python", run:

python manage.py test samurai_client_python

Tests should pass.

Since this includes code automatically generated by Django, Django's license (BSD) is included.
